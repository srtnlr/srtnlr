### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Sertan Anlar. I am an automotive engineer, I graduated from Ã‡ukurova University in 2020. I joined the Crypto world around 2 years ago, although not too early. The crypto world intrigued me and I liked it. I took part in various projects such as Massa Labs, Avail, Aptos, Celestia. I also work in the Avalanche community. I believe that I will take part in many more beautiful projects thanks to my interest and passion. I'm excited and impatient for this.
